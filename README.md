# Jan's Pixel Library

This repo holds Jan's libgdx game development tools and resources that he uses to make pixel art games. The library aims to support multiple engine types from 2D and 3D games to Object Oriented and ECS built game systems and models.

## Features

Core features of this library will try to implement major obsticles found in personal game developement using libGDX and other frameworks. The true intention of the library is to help bridge the gap between the libGDX framework and the dream 3D ECS Pixelart game I always dreamed of.

Features to reach this dream are:
  - Pixel Art Shaders
    - 3D to Pixel Art
    - Pallet Changing / Choosing  
  - Core Game ECS Systems
    - Easy World Entity Creation
    - Player Controls
      - Point and Click Controls
      - Keyboard Controls
      - Controller Controls
    - Programmatic World Generation and Simulation
      - Bioms
      - Tiles Based
      - Water Simulation
      - Realistic Weather Simulation
      - Infinite World Generation
    - ECS Based Render Systems
    - User Interface Creation and Customization
